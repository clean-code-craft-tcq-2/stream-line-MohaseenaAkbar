Step 1 - Write test cases to read_data_from_console
Step 2 - Add read_data_from_console definition in receiver.py file with some dummy return value to make it compile.
step 3-  Add real functionality inside read_data_from_console. Receiver is not available.Hence stub the receiver input in receiver_stub.py
step 4 - read the input from stubbed receiver_stub and return number of readings in read_data_from_console API.
step 5 - Console output is stored in list.Now add min and max value test case to find out in list.
step 6 - Add Find_Min_Max API in receiver.py and return dummy value to make it compile
step 7 - Add test case for simple moving average
